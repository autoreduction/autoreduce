# WebApp

Application for users to monitor and rerun jobs. Also, used for support staff to monitor the health of the Autoreduction (backend) service. Note the (backend) Autoreduction service is independent of the WebApp; in the scenario where the WebApp stops working the Autoreduction service will continue to reduced data.
